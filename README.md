## Summary
Refactoring code has lots of advantages as it will improve performance, efficiency, improve the readability of the code and shorten code in some cases. But at the same time, refactoring code do not change the results generated but may still take lot of time to refactor. 
If the individual do not understand the code, there is risk of inadvertently ruining perfectly running code.
